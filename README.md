# Link-shortner
A awsome tool i made to shorten links for personal use i used resources from uiverse.io and is really happy how this prodject turned out.
(Even though it is unsecure by having everything locally on the clients phone but je for now its fine)

to use the link extentions i call it

the shortcode: could be literally anything just dont duplicate.
the reference: (any phrase just no spaces use _ or - as spaces).
and the mode: (timed or direct).

?id=ShortCode1&ref=Universal&mode=timed
?id=ShortCode2&ref=Universal&mode=direct
